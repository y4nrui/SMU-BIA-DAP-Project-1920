    "Q: I want to scrape FBS, what do I need to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Before you start scraping FBS, do the following:\n",
    "1. Replace the chrome_path below to the location of the chrome driver in your computer.\n",
    "2. If you want to automatically login, save your credentials in a file called userpw.txt in the following format:\n",
    "username:\n",
    "password:\n",
    "3. Open up Scrape_Facility_List and generate the list of facility details first. Make sure that the files generated are in the same directory as this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: So what exactly does this file do?\n",
    "A: It logins to FBS using your credentials, and references off a list of facilities for the school(s) of your choice.\n",
    "It will generate a list of bookings for the past 2 weeks in a csv file for each school you have specified. \n",
    "At the moment, the facility type is set to be GSRs.\n"
