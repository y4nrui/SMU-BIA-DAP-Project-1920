The new cases bring the total number of people with the coronavirus in Singapore to seven. Both patients are Chinese nationals from Wuhan in Hubei province. A 56-year-old male arrived from Wuhan on Jan 19 and subsequently developed a cough on Jan 25. MOH said he then presented himself at Changi General Hospital on Jan 26 and tested positive for the virus the next day. The ministry said he stayed at his family home at Pasir Ris Grove before his hospital admission.In a Facebook post, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said officers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) visited the condominium in Pasir Ris Grove and were working with its management to disinfect and clean common areas such as lifts, the playground and the gym. \"They have also advised the occupants of the affected unit, who have disinfected their home,\" said Mr Teo, who is Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC. \"The occupants are now under home quarantine and are required to stay at home and monitor their health,\" he added. The seventh patient to be confirmed with the Wuhan virus is a 35-year-old male, who arrived in Singapore on Jan 23. He developed symptoms on Jan 24 and went to Raffles Hospital, from where he was transferred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases by private ambulance, MOH said. The man subsequently tested positive for coronavirus on Jan 27 at 11pm. Prior to his admission, he stayed at Marina Bay Sands, the Health Ministry added. MOH said the trend of infection among the population of Chinese nationals from Hubei in Singapore is accelerating. The ministry added that 95 per cent of confirmed cases in Chinese cities were recently in Hubei province.This confirms the conclusion that the infection has spread most widely in the province, the ministry said.MOH added that there is \"no evidence of community spread in Singapore currently, but this presents a heightened risk to Singapore\". As such, enhanced measures are being put in place to limit the risk that travellers from Hubei pose to Singapore. These include quarantine for recent travellers from Hubei already in Singapore who are assessed to be of higher risk.Returning residents and long-term pass holders with travel history in Hubei or with Chinese passports issued in Hubei will also be quarantined. New visitors with recent travel history to Hubei within the last 14 days or holding Chinese passports issued in Hubei will not be allowed entry or transit through Singapore from noon on Wednesday. The deadly virus has killed at least 106 people in China so far, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases.The Singapore Government on Monday announced a new set of measures designed to contain the virus, including enhanced temperature screening and compulsory leave of absence for students and teachers returning from China.Singapore\\'s first confirmed case was a 66-year-old Wuhan man who stayed at Shangri-La\\'s Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. This was followed by the confirmed cases of the man\\'s 37-year-old son and a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan.On Sunday, MOH announced the fourth confirmed case of the Wuhan virus - a 36-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who had stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa.A fifth case was confirmed on Monday: A 56-year-old female Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with her family on Jan 18.Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram', 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-death-toll-china-cases-coronavirus-12360208': 'BEIJING: China said on Tuesday (Jan 28) that 106 people had died from a new coronavirus that is spreading across the country, up from the previous toll of 81.The number of total confirmed cases in China rose to 4,515 as of Jan 27, the National Health Commission said in a statement, up from 2,835 reported a day earlier.There were nearly 7,000 more cases suspected and awaiting confirmation, according to the commission.China on Tuesday postponed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities across the country over concerns about the outbreak.Students are currently on holiday for Chinese New Year and the education ministry did not provide a date for teaching to resume.But a statement from the ministry said teaching institutions would reopen on a case-by-case basis.School administrators had been instructed to \"require students not to go out, not to gather, and not to hold or participate in centralised activities\", the statement added.\\n\\nChina\\'s National Health Commission said in a briefing on Tuesday that an additional 6,000 medical staff has been mobilised to tackle the outbreak in Hubei. Authorities on Monday decided to extend the Chinese New Year holiday, originally due to end on Jan 30, for three days to limit population flows and control the epidemic.The virus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since been identified in more than a dozen other countries, including the first confirmed patients in Canada and Sri Lanka.China last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record, and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.As those trapped in Wuhan have become increasingly anxious, governments have scrambled to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million.The United States, France and Japan are among those to have announced plans for airlifts, but nearly a week after the lockdown the evacuations have yet to happen.A chartered US-bound flight had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens.But the State Department said that had been postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason.France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans.Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so.DESPERATE EFFORTSMedical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town.China has deployed hundreds of military medics to ease the pressure, and started building two hospitals with the aim of finishing them in just 10 days.AFP reporters saw hundreds of mask-wearing workers toiling around the clock to assemble one of the pre-fab field hospitals.Construction began just days ago but the outline of a floor was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up on Monday.\"We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,\" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP.Stressed Wuhan residents living under the quarantine expressed fears for the health and dwindling supplies at home.\"I\\'m getting more concerned every day,\" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP.FIGHTING SPIRITBut Wuhan\\'s people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit.Quarantined residents shouted \"Go Wuhan\" from their windows, according to videos posted online.A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red.The World Health Organization said on Monday that it remained unclear if the deadly virus is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear.It did not immediately confirm assertions made by Chinese authorities that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties.The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a Wuhan market illegally selling wildlife. Much is not known, including how easily it spreads and just how deadly it is.Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram', 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-obs-camp-pulau-ubin-quarantine-facility-12360724': 'SINGAPORE: Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) camps on Pulau Ubin will be used as a quarantine facility as part of measures to deal with the Wuhan virus, the Ministry of National Development (MND) said on Tuesday (Jan 28).In response to CNA queries, an MND spokesperson said the Government will ensure that anyone who has been served with a quarantine order will be housed in \"appropriate locations\".\"In addition to selected chalets and university hostels, OBS camps in Pulau Ubin have also been identified as a Government Quarantine Facility (GQF),\" the spokesperson added.The camps will undergo a \"thorough cleaning process\", in accordance with guidelines from the Ministry of Health, to make sure they are safe to stay in.\"As people staying at the GQFs are not supposed to come into contact with others, this eliminates the possibility of the spread of virus through person-to-person contact,\" the spokesperson added.The new coronavirus, which originated in China’s Wuhan, has killed more than 100 people and infected more than 4,000.There have been seven confirmed cases in Singapore.The quarantine facilities are \"part of the Government\\'s response plan for emergencies and may be activated from time to time\", the MND spokesperson said.It is possible that they may be used as quarantine housing to prevent the spread of the Wuhan virus among the community, MND added. On Monday, Singapore announced that three hostels each from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU) will be used as quarantine facilities. Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said at a press conference that most students, including foreigners, that are affected will be transferred to other hostels on campus.He apologised to the students affected and said that \"this is part of the national response\".\"We hope it won\\'t happen, but should there be more contact tracing and confirmed cases, then we will need the facilities.

Among the steps implemented by the My First Skool centre is having temperatures taken for parents as they drop off their children. \"These are measures which are needed to ensure the well-being of our children and pre-school staff,\" he said. \"Yesterday we also announced (the implementation of) a leave of absence for children in pre-schools as well as pre-school staff who have visited China in the last 14 days and moving forward.\" He added: \"This is again a stepped-up precautionary measure because in pre-schools and these other social facilities we have more vulnerable communities like young children, elderly, persons with disabilities and so on.\"For parents, please be assured that we have robust measures in place; we are working closely with our pre-school operators.\"As of Jan 27, five cases of the Wuhan virus have been confirmed in Singapore. The deadly virus has killed at least 106 people in China so far, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases.Out of the 25,000 teaching and programme staff in pre-schools, \"early estimates\" have shown that between 500 to 600 pre-school teachers had gone to or will be returning from China, said Mr Lee. In addition, about 1,000 pre-school students had gone to or will be returning from China, he added.My First Skool, which has more than 140 centres islandwide, has rolled out measures such as increased cleaning of facilities, as well as increased frequency of temperature taking to safeguard students and staff, said general manager Ms Thian Ai Ling.\"On a daily basis, we\\'ve always paid close attention to personal hygiene,\" said Ms Thian. \"Given the current situation, what we have stepped up is an additional layer of temperature taking as well as (during) multiple periods throughout the day, we are closely watching our children\\'s well-being, ensuring that they do not show any symptoms. \"Should they do, we will contact parents immediately.\"When reporters visited a My First Skool centre at Buangkok on Tuesday, staff wearing surgical masks were observed taking the temperatures of parents and children upon their arrival outside the centre.The hands of parents and children were also sanitised before they entered the premises.In addition, staff members also made sure to check on the travel history of students and their parents, in the event that they did not complete a travel declaration which was sent last week.As a whole, further steps could be required down the road should the situation change, Mr Lee added.“The situation is fluid and evolving, the Government will look at the available information and evidence, look at the international guidelines and we may need to take further steps as the situation evolves,” he said.For now, parents reporters spoke to said they were generally satisfied with the precautions taken at the centre at Buangkok.\"Even on normal days where there\\'s a typical outbreak like hand,foot and mouth (disease), they would already have taken extra measures for that to ensure that the kids are safe,\" said Mr Lee Tai Yun, who was dropping off his 3-year-old daughter. \"So I\\'m pretty sure that this is just another day in their lives to try and control (the situation).\"However, there are also concerns that others might not have not been upfront about their travel history.\"Not only parents but relatives as well, as we do not know whether the (other) children might have relatives who came back from China.\" said Mdm Janani Rajendran. \"I was considering keeping my child at home because we don\\'t know what are the odds.\"Another parent, Mr Zulfadli Abdullah, said that he had no qualms sending his son to the centre after the Chinese New Year holidays. \"Right now we have these measures in place, and if something were to happen, I would expect more measures.

CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said this impact on tourism will likely start showing as soon as next month, particularly after authorities in China announced a halt of all group tours, both at home and to other countries, with effect from Monday.China is the biggest source of tourists to Singapore, accounting for nearly one fifth of total visitor arrivals, he said.Already, one travel agency has seen a flurry of cancellations by Chinese tour groups over the past few days. Dynasty Travel’s director of public relations and communications Alicia Seah told CNA that its bookings from China for February have “all been cancelled”.Mr Song said: “The latest measure will see visitor arrivals for February being affected and other frontline sectors, like retail and F&B (food and beverage), will also take some impact.” “The longer this ban stays in place, the bigger the impact,” he added. “And if the developments over the next month prove to be not as favourable, then it won’t just be the Chinese that are travelling less but across all nationalities. That will further impact the tourism-related sectors here.”Ms Selena Ling, OCBC’s head of treasury research and strategy, also told CNA that the tour cancellations, alongside some hit to business and economic confidence, in the wake of the Wuhan virus outbreak will likely “cast a shadow” over Singapore’s economic growth momentum in the first quarter of 2020.In a bid to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, China has also rolled out other measures, such as extending the Chinese New Year holiday. The effect of this extended break on factory output, alongside lower consumer spending as people stay at home, will have a “significant hit” on the Chinese economy for the first quarter, said economist Rajiv Biswas from IHS Markit. This weaker Chinese demand for imports of goods and services could have “flow-on effects” to Singapore’s manufacturing sector, which exports raw materials, intermediate and finished goods to China, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific added.FULL IMPACT STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL: ECONOMISTSBut beyond that, these three economists stressed that it is still too early to assess the full impact of the virus on the Singapore economy.Ms Ling said: “The key questions are how long this will last, whether it will get more severe from here and what control measures are taken that might disrupt productivity. “While people seem to be looking to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as a proxy, it is still too early to tell the full impact for now.”Echoing that, Mr Biswas said the extent of the negative hit on Singapore’s economic growth remains “highly uncertain, depending on the speed with which the Wuhan virus epidemic is contained”.Mr Song also noted that at the moment, consumer confidence in Singapore appears to be unaffected. “The thing to note is whether people are reassured by the immediate remedial measures that have been implemented. Compared with the SARS period where we were dealing with a virus outbreak for the first time, we’ve since had Zika and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and I think we are far better prepared in our preventive measures,” he said.“People seem to have gone on with their daily activities for now, though more are wearing masks. As long as people carry on with their daily lives, the impact on domestic activities won’t be as severe.”Nevertheless, economists noted that the outbreak coincides with a dip in overall exports and growth in Singapore’s economy, suggesting less wiggle room should a worst case scenario happens. As such, Ms Ling said she is mulling a slash in the lower-end of her full-year growth estimate.“We were looking at 1 to 2 per cent for Singapore’s economy in 2020, but we may adjust to 0 to 2 per cent to accommodate the potential downside risks,” she said.HELP FOR AFFECTED BUSINESSES – HOW BIG AND HOW SOON? Mr Chan on Monday had said that the Government will implement necessary measures to help businesses impacted by the Wuhan virus, as with previous episodes such as the SARS outbreak in 2003. These could include reducing business costs, alleviating cash flow problems and help to retain workers. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Government rolled out a S$230 million relief package to support the most adversely hit sectors.For the tourism-related industries, these included property tax rebates, reduction in foreign worker levy for unskilled workers, a bridging loan programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises to alleviate short-term cash-flow problems and enhanced training grants.The transport sector saw targeted measures such as diesel tax rebates for taxis and waivers of taxi operator license fees.Economists said it remains too early to speculate if the Government will release a relief package of a similar quantum this time round. They also had mixed views if help could come as early as the upcoming Budget in February.For instance, Mr Biswas thinks the upcoming Budget statement, which will be delivered on Feb 18 by Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, could include measures to assist the vulnerable tourism and travel sectors.On the other hand, Ms Ling reckoned that it is still early days into the virus outbreak and the Government could take a “wait and watch\" approach.IMPACT ACROSS THE REST OF ASIA As of Tuesday, the death toll in China has jumped to 106 and the number of total confirmed cases up to 4,515, the country’s authorities said.Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States, heightening fears of the global economic impact of the new deadly virus. For Asia Pacific, the Wuhan coronavirus poses a “significant downside risk” to region’s economic outlook in the near term, if the epidemic continues to escalate in coming weeks, said Mr Biswas.“The extent and duration of this negative shock to regional economic growth will depend on how quickly the Wuhan virus epidemic can be brought under control, which remains very uncertain.” Governments in Asia Pacific are likely to respond with a range of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus measures to prop up growth momentum in the near term.

This, along with a message Madam Choong sent her husband on Jan 10, 2017, showed that she knew about the financial problems, said Mr Han.Teo had said that his wife found about about his debts only on Jan 13, 2017, when a creditor turned up at their house and asked his wife for the S$21,000 Teo owed.In her message on Jan 10, 2017, Mdm Choong wrote: \"Baby I\\'m sorry. I feel so helpless that I can\\'t help you to pay all the debts and you have to pay alone. I know your limits. Please wait for me, after our son is two years old then I can go back to work. At least both of us can work and clear our debts.\"In response, Teo replied: \"Ok baby it is my duty to work for the house. I will work harder to settle all our debt.\"Mr Han said Teo did not bring up the topic of his wife seeking part-time work in any of the chat logs retrieved from his phone. Teo said he spoke to her about it in person and claimed she did not want to take on part-time work.  Mr Han said that there was not \"a single harsh word\" either from his wife to Teo or from Teo to his wife in the chat logs.Instead, the couple were affectionate to each other in their frequent messages, expressing their love for each other, with Teo saying he missed his wife, their daughter and their unborn son, whom he called \"small small baby\".TEO NEVER FORGAVE HIS WIFE FOR AFFAIR: PROSECUTORMr Han also charged that Teo \"never forgave\" his wife for the affair she had in 2014 and never forgot it either.\"I forget,\" responded Teo. \"I forgive her and forget the incident.\"However, Mr Han produced a report from a psychiatrist who interviewed Teo. The report read: \"Accused reported that \\'I forgave about 60 per cent, but I never forget.\"\"In fact, Mr Teo, you went further than that,\" said Mr Han. \"You would skip your lunchtime and the time to meet your clients to spot check on (Mdm Choong), didn\\'t you?\"Teo said he did not remember.Mr Han continued quoting Teo from the documents presented to the court: \"I became increasingly distracted at work, worrying all the time that my wife was cheating on me while I was at work. As such, I started cancelling appointments in the middle of the day to conduct spot checks on my wife and this greatly affected my sales volume.\"Teo said he had tried to forgive and forget.\"It takes time for a man to forgive and forget,\" he said, referring to the period of time immediately following the affair in 2014. \"By the time, after one year, I really tried to forgive and forget for the sake of my daughter.\"However, Mr Han said Teo had still not forgotten about it in January 2017.Teo had told his wife: \"I\\'m working so hard to provide for the family. You even refused to find a part-time job to supplement the household income. How can we get by with so many monthly expenses on my salary alone? I don\\'t even know what you are doing when you are at home. Are you just surfing Facebook and visiting someone’s Facebook page?\"Teo had specified that the \"someone\" referred to the man he caught his wife having an affair with in 2014.However, Teo maintained that he had forgiven his wife, on account of his daughter.The trial continues for the rest of the week, with the defence continuing its case. At the close of its case, the prosecution offered to the defence as a possible defence witness the man whom the victim had an affair with.Other than the accused, the defence said on Tuesday morning that it intended to call a psychiatrist, as well as a relative of the accused, to the stand.If found guilty of murder, Teo faces the death penalty.', 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-beijing-first-death-outbreak-12359158': 'BEIJING: China\\'s capital on Monday (Jan 27) recorded its first death from a deadly coronavirus as it struggles to contain a rapidly spreading disease that has sparked global alarm, with countries scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the epicentre of the epidemic.At least 106 people have died from the virus in China, and more than 4,000 people have been infected across the nation.Cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries, including the first confirmed patients in Canada and Sri Lanka.The United States urged its citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China and told them not to go to central Hubei province, where the pneumonia-like virus emerged. Mongolia closed its vast border to vehicles from China.In a sign of the mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited ground zero to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease first appeared late last month.The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, effectively trapping tens of millions of people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the Chinese New Year holiday unfolds.China decided to extend the holiday, initially due to end on Jan 30, for three days to limit population flows and control the epidemic.US President Donald Trump said the United States has offered China \"any help that is necessary\" in combating the virus.The health commission in the capital said a 50 year-old-man who visited Wuhan died of respiratory failure on Monday, less than three weeks after visiting the city.More than 700 new infections were confirmed in the country, while the number of suspected cases doubled over a 24-hour period to nearly 6,000.The youngest infected patient was a nine-month-old baby being treated in Beijing.In Wuhan, AFP reporters saw construction workers labouring on one of two field hospitals that China is racing to complete by next week to relieve overcrowded facilities swamped with people waiting for medical attention.On day five under quarantine, residents shouted \"Go Wuhan\" from their windows, according to videos posted online, and a building lit up the night sky with the words in red.\"I\\'m getting more concerned every day,\" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP.GLOBAL FEARS SPREADLandlocked Mongolia - which is heavily dependent on trade with China - closed the border with its huge neighbour to cars, cancelled classes until Mar 2 and suspended large public gatherings.Malaysia banned visitors from Hubei province.Turkey and Germany advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China altogether.A US-bound flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens.

He arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20, after flying in from Guangzhou on China Southern flight CZ351. He reported having a sore throat while on the flight but no fever. He developed a fever the next day and began coughing. After arriving in Singapore, the man checked in to Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. On Jan 22, he told hotel staff that he was unwell and was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he was isolated and diagnosed with pneumonia. He was identified to the Ministry of Health as a suspected Wuhan virus case at 10pm. On Jan 23 at 6pm, he tested positive for the new coronavirus. The Health Ministry then moved to identify the man's close contacts. A total of 46 were identified, with 17 contacted. Twenty-four were determined to have left Singapore, including the man's eight travel companions. Another travel companion, his son, is now a confirmed case. The patient remains in isolation at SGH and is in stable condition. Meanwhile, the Shangri-La Group said they have disinfected the rooms occupied by the man and his guests, and placed workers who cleaned the rooms and interacted with him on quarantine. The patient indicated he had kept within the hotel vicinity during his stay. 2) 37-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM WUHANThe 66-year-old man's son, who was a suspected case on Jan 23, became a confirmed case on Jan 24. The 37-year-old had been staying with his father at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa.

And in China, avocado has also become a social media superstar since a fitness craze took the country by storm about six years ago.More and more people are working out, toning up and showing off on social media, including what they eat to help burn fat and gain muscles.In Shanghai, one avocado restaurant is taking to social media at a whole new level, with its marketing done entirely through word of mouth online.Kiss Avocado even has a pink decor to attract girls who would “take selfies and post on social media”, said co-owner Lynn Yin. And as the Chinese middle class grows, more of them are eating such trendy foods.A decade ago, China’s volume of avocado imports was low: 31.8 tonnes in 2011. But it has increased by more than 1,300 times, to 43,000 tonnes in 2018.Previously, an avocado from Mexico retailed domestically at about 50 yuan (S$10), in no small measure because of a 40 per cent total tax rate for the fruit.But in 2014, Beijing granted market access to Chile. And under a bilateral free trade agreement, Chilean avocados have since entered with zero tariffs. By 2017, half of China’s avocados came from the South American country.The fruit now costs about 10 to 15 yuan, whereas in Chile, the price has tripled to 3,200 pesos (S$6) per kilogramme, observed FoodyChile tour guide Colin Bennett.“When I first moved here (12 years ago), it was 1,000 pesos a kilo,” said the American, who settled in Santiago, the capital.The price increase, however, is not the only concern in the world’s third-largest producer of avocados. As its exports increase, so too have its environmental problems.And the programme China’s Growing Appetite questions whether Chinese consumers should wake up to how their “food-print” affects other countries. (Watch the episode here.)WATER SHORTAGEChilean activist Rodrigo Mundaca knows all about his country’s problems with big avocado plantations, especially in Petorca, a major avocado-producing region in central Chile.It has the kind of warm climate and stable temperatures for the fruit to thrive, except that a lot of water is needed.The amount of water it takes to produce one avocado is enough to grow three oranges or 14 tomatoes. And plantations have been extracting “more water than authorised”, said Mundaca, who is fighting to protect local communities’ access to water.A 2011 investigation by Chile’s water authority showed at least 65 illegal underground channels bringing water from the rivers to private plantations.The investigation led to criminal convictions of some agribusinesses, but that was not enough to stop them from trying again.They still dug riverside wells to irrigate their fields, Mundaca pointed out at one such site that was fenced off to keep it out of sight.“This is a river. It’s a national good for public use,” he said. “You can’t simply install underground water (systems). This is fully illegal.”One of the province’s rivers, the Ligua River, was declared depleted as far back as 2004 — “overexploited” by avocado producers, he added.In the past 10 years, however, central Chile has also been living with a mega-drought. So nearly half of the country’s rural homes — some one million people — do not have regular access to drinking water nowadays.As the groundwater level continues to drop, the local government has resorted to trucking water to Petorca’s rural residents. They are among 380,000 people in Chile receiving water from tankers as part of emergency measures declared last year.Asked if the plantations can be stopped from drawing too much water, Petorca municipal government’s water affairs manager Carolina Vilches replied that the municipality “doesn’t have the power to evaluate the environmental impact of agriculture”.“The ministry that has that power doesn’t consider agriculture as something that could impact the environment. Therefore the impact isn’t assessed,” she said.WATCH: Avocado madness in China is sucking Chile dry (3:47)VILLAGERS VS FARMSIt is obvious, however, that families are struggling with the lack of water. “(The most difficult thing) is seeing how everything dies — it’s terrible to see our little plants die — (and) washing up with so little water,” said Zoila Quiroz.Her family, who have lived in the Petorca valley for generations, used to get water from a stream four kilometres away. But it dried up, and they do not own rights to dig a well to get water.That is not the case for the avocado farms surrounding the family on all sides. “The avocado trees have more rights than us, the human beings,” added Quiroz, wishing that the farms could all go.“I think this is the only part of the world where water is sold like candy.”It turns out that in Chile, water rights are treated like property and granted in perpetuity by the government. With the drought, and plantations sometimes drawing more water than they have rights to, there are no more rights to allocate.While villagers are losing out in this way, Allent Vega Diaz disagrees that the criticisms are fair. The farm manager from Cabilfrut, the biggest avocado exporter in Petorca, pointed out that Chilean law “doesn’t discriminate between the uses of water”.Nor does he think the government should change the law. “The government needs to invest to secure water for the population. People without water need water; they don’t need laws,” he said.“This area needs agriculture. Agriculture is the main activity in this area.”He added that Cabilfrut has about 3,000 hectares of orchards but is using only about 200 hectares “because we don’t have water for all the areas”.He is waiting for the next rainy season so that plantations can be irrigated and production restarted — even as Chile’s worst drought in 60 years spiked last year, with rainfall hitting new lows.A BETTER WAY?Seeing as Petorca’s water problems began before China became a market, CNA correspondent and Chongqing native Wei Du noted that “in a way, it’s really not our fault”.“But now we’re part of the problem … it does make you wonder, isn’t there a better way?” she questioned.There is, according to Mundaca, the leader of water rights movement Modatima. “Nowadays there are some markets such as Denmark’s that have restricted the purchase of avocados from Petorca … because these companies have left our communities without water,” he cited.The fruit has also been removed from menus elsewhere in Europe. But he pointed out that the agribusinesses have “signalled publicly that if the European market ceases to import Chilean avocados, they’d move on to China”.Some top producers in the region are already selling up to a third of their crop to China. That is a disproportionate share, given that China accounts for about 10 per cent of Chile’s avocado exports.Having seen how China’s changing eating habits can affect other countries, Wei said: “We’ve been told for decades now that eating extravagantly is what the good life is about. So I wonder, is it time to set new ideals?”Read about whether bamboo rats are an eco-friendly answer to growing appetites for meat, and about how China’s love of durian is reshaping the Thai countryside.', 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/crickets-algae-soya-discard-3-future-foods-made-in-singapore-12252394': 'SINGAPORE: Pasta, cookies and wine are comfort food to some Singaporeans.

But how receptive would people be? And taste aside, how healthy is such a diet?

He co-founded Asia Insect Farm Solutions, which has cricket farm tie-ups across Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, after finding that insects were better than plant-based options.“I can claim that (insects) are more nutrient-dense than any other plant- or animal-based product,” he said.“Plant-based options have to go through very extensive processing in terms of isolating the protein so that it’s high enough for us to consume and fulfil our nutritious needs.”Crickets are his insect of choice because they multiply quickly, are more likely to be toxin-free and are already consumed in some parts of the world.Farming crickets is also kinder to the environment. Their greenhouse gas emissions average 1 gramme per kilogramme of weight gain, compared with 2,850 g for cattle, 1,300 g for pigs and 300 g for chickens.“(Crickets) are very efficient in converting the feed they eat into body and muscle mass. For example, 2 kg of feed … contributes to 1 kg of body mass,” Raavee said, adding that water sources are not needed in their enclosures.“All the water they need is obtained from their feed diet. In terms of land space, about 1 square metre is able to produce about 10 kg of crickets.”Once they have reached a certain size, that’s when his start-up powderises them into a flour of sorts.“We pack them in the freezer for them to go into a state of deep sleep, and then once they’re ready … we put them through a heating process (which) dehydrates them. At the same time, it kills any bacteria,” he explained. “We then put them through a grinding process.”The result is a flour-like texture, which he said is “naturally much more nutritious” than beef, with about twice as much protein per 100g and all the essential amino acids.“Humans need about 20 amino acids in general. But nine of them can’t be produced naturally by our body. Crickets deliver all nine that we need,” he cited.The idea is to create a versatile product that could work well with any flour-based recipe. And so that consumers do not “detect a very distinct difference in flavour”, his company had to get the cricket feed and processing right.Still, there may be a yuck factor in most people’s minds, he acknowledged. “So we’re going to focus on creating tasty food products that people can get on board with,” he said.Because we want consumers to get a higher level of nutrition, but at the same time, enjoy the taste they’re familiar with.As far as Ethan Nava is concerned, he could not tell that the cricket-based pasta and cookies he had on the show was anything unconventional.“Crickets aren’t so bad. If it were cockroaches, I’d feel like it may be a different story, whereas crickets are just in the grass, hopping around,” he said.WATCH: Your pasta will be made from crickets: Future foods (4:00)LIKE GRIME ON FISH TANKSAnother organic material that can be added to flour-based ingredients is microalgae. It is considered plant protein, and the man who created Singapore’s first microalgae food thinks that growing such an alternative protein source here is “quite logical”.“Because we can’t rely on imported legumes or plants,” said Ricky Lin, the founder of Life3 Biotech.The government is on a “30 by 30” drive — to have 30 per cent of Singapore’s nutritional needs produced locally by 2030, up from less than 10 per cent.To this end, Lin’s firm is using equipment called bioreactors to grow and harvest microalgae, single-cell organisms that live in water. The controlled conditions induce photosynthesis, prompting the cells to split and multiply.Compared with agricultural crops, microalgae production requires only a tenth of the space. They can grow up to 20 times faster. And a little could go a long way at the dining table.“If we’re able to formulate food using maybe 30 per cent of microalgae (dried into a powder) as a raw ingredient, then … about 30 g is good enough for a portion (size),” Lin reckoned.He acknowledged that “the grime you see in your fish tank” comes to mind when thinking about food made from microalgae. But he added that humans have been eating algal products for a “few thousand years”.He compared seaweeds, which are macroalgae, to their micro-organic cousins. “At the cellular level, (living things) are pretty much the same. We eat animals caught in the wild, for example fish. And the fish feed on this microorganism,” he said.“So why don’t we go directly to the food chain itself at the base level?”As for the taste test, Why It Matters host Joshua Lim tried microalgal noodles, and they reminded him of noodles with soya bean paste or even green tea soba. “Very tasty noodles,” he said in between mouthfuls. “Very light.”TOFU TIPPLESingapore’s reliance on imported food could be reduced also if food waste is turned into desirable food, considering that 640,000 tonnes were thrown away in 2018. And that is what makes the brainchild of Chua Jian Yong special.The PhD student at the National University of Singapore has created an alcoholic beverage whose base ingredient comes from soya bean. It tastes somewhat like white wine but is made from a liquid whey that is otherwise discarded.The production of tofu generates two by-products: Okara, the soya bean pulp; and the whey. Both are commonly thrown away by tofu manufacturers, but Chua has been taking the whey and converting it into what he calls Sachi.“Soy whey itself contains nutrients. So if you dispose of soy whey into the drainage without processing, it can result in water pollution in the long run,” he said.So rather than spend energy and resources to process the whey, “why not convert this by-product into a consumer beverage”, he figured.Sugar and fruit acid, which is commonly found in beverages, are added to the whey and mixed well before the fermentation process starts. They provide nutrients and an optimum condition for yeast to grow as part of the alcohol production.After fermentation, the yeast is centrifuged out, leaving behind a clear beverage. “The alcohol (content) for this drink is about 7 per cent, which is similar to moscato,” added Chua, the chief technology officer of NUS spin-off SinFooTech.Lim enjoyed the Sachi “maybe a bit too much”, while it also fared well among the bar patrons he approached to give it a go. And it is sold in a nice-looking bottle, he noted.BIG MONEYAny novel food product to be launched in Singapore must first go through an approval process, so that should allay any consumer concern about “having Frankenstein food being fed to us”, said food scientist Christiani Jeyakumar Henry.But there is still the question of the effects of the latest sustainable foods on human health in the long run. There is lack of research evidence, he pointed out — even though products like cricket flour can be tested.The professor’s tests, for example, found that the flour was made of 49 per cent protein and 19 per cent fat, whereas wheat flour has about 11 per cent protein and 2 per cent fat.While the product’s nutritional content was “pretty impressive”, he pointed out that “it’s a bit of an oxymoron” to call it cricket “flour”, because “in our vocabulary, flour normally comes from a cereal”.“The point made was that cricket has got more protein than a beef steak, and I think that’s true,” said the director of the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.When it comes to “regular and prolonged consumption”, however, there is no “hard and fast data on … the long-term consequence”. But his prediction for the future is that these food technologies will be “unstoppable”.“In 20 years’ time, we’ll need to look at alternative sources of protein to match what we currently have,” he said. “(And) there’s an incredible amount of venture capital coming into food technology.”Agri-food start-up companies raised about US$17 billion (S$23 billion) globally in 2018, up by 43 per cent from 2017 and by up to sixfold since 2012.“These are exciting times, incredible times — no parallel in human history. But at the same time, we’re trying to ask the question: What are they health benefits? If they’re good, bravo!” said Henry.“If you’re a venture capitalist, you want — in the long term — to be a surviving capitalist. And to do that, you have to tell the consumer what’s the added value … I’m arguing that it’s nutrition that will win the day.”Watch this season finale of Why It Matters here.', 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/low-down-parents-whatsapp-group-chats-are-they-becoming-toxic-12231172': 'SINGAPORE: Banu Partiban’s daughter was in her first month at primary school when she and her husband received a WhatsApp message from another parent.“It was a picture message. This parent circled my child. The parent wrote, ‘Can I know who’s the parent of this child?’” she recounted.It was sent to a parents’ group chat, which was “not a very nice thing to (do)”. An upset Banu had parents approaching her, seemingly thinking something was wrong, to ask what happened and why her girl was singled out.She reached out to the parent privately — the better approach in the first place, she thought. It turned out that their children had a minor dispute, which they eventually resolved.The incident came as a “shock”, occurring within days of her joining the WhatsApp group. But she remained in the group because, as a working parent, she did not want to miss anything important for her child’s schooling.Chances are parents today are in a parents’ group chat or even a few groups. But not all see the need for this.Some parents — and children — describe these WhatsApp groups as “competitive”, and as the question of whether to stay or leave arises, the programme Talking Point investigates whether parents’ group chats are even becoming toxic or inadvertently hurting children. (Watch the episode here.)THE 90-9-1 TYPES OF PARENTSWinston Tay, for one, was in a group chat when his child was in Primary One to Primary Three, but he left because the parents had “a lot of idiosyncrasies”.“On Sunday nights especially, there’d be a flurry of messages,” he recalled, citing queries about homework for the weekend.“And we realised that we had certain parents who’d … ask, ‘How have your kids’ results been? My kids’ results are this.’ So after a while, it started getting a little bit annoying.”On the other hand, these WhatsApp groups have been “very useful” for mother of two, Serene Seah, who admitted to being “forgetful” and needing reminders.The two parents belong to two of the three types of people generally in online communities, which are what parents’ WhatsApp groups are.Research by the Nielsen Norman Group found that 90 per cent of users are quiet observers who only read the messages, 9 per cent are active in the conversations, and 1 per cent are very active users who provide a lot of information.While that is a general view of online communities, Talking Point found specific descriptors associated with people in parents’ WhatsApp groups: The blur sotong; the know-it-all; the chat-a-lot; the show-off; the life coach; and the lurker, who does not contribute.With such parents in these WhatsApp groups, chat administrators such as William Choo must play the role of “policeman” to ensure that the chats stay civil.“(Some parents) try to dig out information like … your kid’s score,” said the father of three. “I’d try to tell them, ‘Please don’t compare.’“We need to have someone (as) the neutral party, to let every member of the group chat have peace of mind, for example (through) simple rules like ‘No messaging after, say, 11pm’ … no sensitive issues (and) no bad-mouthing each other.”IMPACT ON TEACHERSThe use of WhatsApp could also expose teachers to disparaging remarks, insults and contempt shown by parents.For example, one of the reasons Lenny Syafawatie Abdul Rahman gave up teaching at primary school after 14 years was she had to manage difficult parents, offline and online, even when she was not part of these group chats.“You’d think twice about what you say in class because you’re afraid that whatever you say would be misinterpreted by the kids,” said the full-time tutor. “Parents would spread it among themselves (and) change the whole story.Parents are quicker to share the negatives rather than the positives.In one incident when she had a class of 40 pupils, a parent took a snapshot of her marking and put it in the group chat.“She said, ‘You all better check your kid’s work. This teacher just anyhow marks.’ It was actually one (mathematics answer) marked wrongly,” Lenny related.“Nowadays (parents) are a bit kiasu, they get a bit kancheong (anxious), so they all panicked, and they started checking each and every one of their kid’s work … I was a bit upset because it was a small matter.”The 35-year-old agreed with Talking Point host Diana Ser that, from a parent’s perspective, WhatsApp group chats “allow for some kind of checks and balances” in that parents should know what happens within a school and the issues at stake.But she suggested checking with the teacher involved rather than making “a mountain out of a molehill” by, for example, “going straight to school leaders”.In these situations, Seah tries to “send positive vibes\" in her group chats. “When you feel that the tension is building up, like resentment against the teachers, someone’s got to be there to put out the fire,” she said.CREATING A CRUTCH?As a tool to improve parental involvement and keep up with what goes on at school, WhatsApp group chats work a treat, especially for parents worried about their children not paying attention in class or forgetting to take notes.But if parents rely on others for information to fill in gaps like test dates, does this not make their children less self-reliant?Xavier Chua is one who “often” forgets to do his homework, but parents in his mother’s group chat would keep her informed, and then he gets scolded.To him, however, that is not the trouble with these groups. “The bad part comes when the parents share other people’s results,” said the 11-year-old, whose parents may sometimes point out those with higher marks to him.Manassvi Arora, who is also 11 years old, agreed. “Sometimes when you compare results in the chat, like when everybody (scores) better than you … you can take it positively if it (happens) the first or second time,” she said.“But when it always happens, you feel kind of bad that you can’t be better than the rest of your classmates.”Despite the competition encountered, the five pupils Talking Point had gathered did not want their parents to leave these group chats — as that would mean, said 10-year-old Belinda Low, that “we have to pay more attention at school”.Digital literacy trainer Carol Loi, who runs workshops on parenting in the digital age, said parents may not be supporting their children’s learning if they “provide them with a crutch all the time”.She recommends helping children to see the consequences of “some of the things that they’ve forgotten” and what they can “learn from the whole experience”.“That’s more important than going straight to … get the information for them and just give it to them,” said the 49-year-old.For parents evaluating whether to leave their group chats, Choo has this piece of advice: “If you can 100 per cent depend on your kids — that means you don’t rely on this ‘information centre’ — (then) you can do it.”Watch this episode of Talking Point here. New episodes on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9.30pm.', 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/bamboo-rats-china-meat-food-chinese-farm-brothers-12217506': 'JIANGXI, China: Tucked at the edge of bamboo-covered mountains in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province is a small niche farm that could be China’s answer to its insatiable appetite for meat: Bamboo rats.Kept as pets by some, these slow-moving rodents look like cute over-sized guinea pigs, but two young vloggers in this farm are breeding them as a source of food.And they have rocketed to Internet fame by chronicling their day-to-day life on this rat farm.Asked if the critters were too cute to be killed for food, Liu Suliang, co-owner of Chinese Farm Brothers, quipped: “I’m willing to. It’s just like raising chicken or goats. I can’t possibly send them to university.”Regarded as agricultural pests, these furry bamboo rats are rodents that feed on the roots of crop plants such as sugar cane, tapioca and bamboo.But increasingly, they are getting recognised as valuable food animals, and they could be the solution to China’s growing appetite for protein, as the programme China’s Growing Appetite discovers. (Watch the episode here.)THE MORE ECOLOGICAL SOURCE?In China, hundreds of millions of people are joining the global middle class, and this rising affluence means they have more money to spend on eating more, and eating better.The country produces nearly all of its own meat, from poultry to pork to beef.But its output of meat is expected to hit some 90 million tonnes by 2023 to 2024, an increase of about 30 per cent from 2012, according to a report by the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.“China’s livestock sector is under pressure from rising costs, disease, environmental regulations and resource constraints,” said the report.Where the Chinese Farm Brothers come from, there’s not much going on in their inland remote village – there are plenty of abandoned houses as many of the young people there have left for the coastal factories.The winding hills of their village also means that finding enough flat land to rear cows or even pigs can be difficult.So mini-livestock like bamboo rats are a much better fit, and they don’t cost very much to rear either - both ecologically and financially.Liu said that the feed is essentially free as the surrounding area is abundant with bamboo.  The duo started with a modest 50 bamboo rats five years ago, and are now selling some 1,000 rats a year, thanks to their online hit series on how to cook these rodents.Marketing their unusual produce took quite a bit of ingenuity.They seemed to have hit a winning formula with their online videos – which usually start with one of them picking up a bamboo rat and declaring that it can’t be saved, and culminating in the rat being grilled.Liu often appears on camera while his partner Hu Yueqing directs, shoots and edits.In one video, Liu picks up a lively, squirming rodent and declares: “This rat looks like it has gotten heat-stroke. It doesn’t seem like it has much energy.”He proceeds to cook and eat the slaughtered rat beside the river.WATCH: Would you eat this? (3:42)The two men, who are not actually brothers, have since amassed millions of followers online with their quirky videos, especially on Chinese video sharing site Bilibili.SAID TO ENHANCE BEAUTYSome Chinese restaurants have already started serving these rats as a delicacy.Zhu Zhibao, executive chef of Prosperous Kitchen in Guangdong Province, said that this practice of eating bamboo rats dates back some 1,000 years, and they are particularly popular among the Cantonese.In fact, the northern part of Guangdong is mountainous and is unsuitable to farm crops or to rear cattle, said Yuan Jiecheng, owner of the restaurant. But there are plenty of rats and snakes.He said that when they first introduced the bamboo rat dish at the restaurant, it wasn’t well-received by the young until online videos popularised it. Yuan also claims that consuming the bamboo rat is good for one’s skin and “it enhances your beauty”.Going forward, Liu thinks that there’s huge potential for their rat business as farming tens of thousands of these rodents wouldn’t be a problem.These rats produce rapidly with three or four litters a year. And the newborns can rapidly grow from 10 grams to 2 kg in just six months.“Right now, supply can’t meet demand. When more people know about bamboo rats, more people will want to eat,” he added. “If one person eats just one rat, the demand would be enormous.”'}\n"
